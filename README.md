 <%= javascript_include_tag :high_charts  %>
 3. add gem name in your config/environment.rb

 For Rails 3.1
In your Gemfile, add this line:
	gem 'lazy_high_charts', '~> 1.1.5'
then execuate command:
  Rails g lazy_high_charts:install

 Usage in Controller:

     @h = LazyHighCharts::HighChart.new('graph') do |f|
        f.options[:chart][:defaultSeriesType] = "area"
        f.series(:name=>'John', :data=>[3, 20, 3, 5, 4, 10, 12 ,3, 5,6,7,7,80,9,9])
        f.series(:name=>'Jane', :data=> [1, 3, 4, 3, 3, 5, 4,-46,7,8,8,9,9,0,0,9] )
      end


  Without overriding entire option , (only change a specific option index):

     @h = LazyHighCharts::HighChart.new('graph') do |f|
      .....
          f.options[:chart][:defaultSeriesType] = "area"
          f.options[:chart][:inverted] = true
          f.options[:legend][:layout] = "horizontal"
          f.options[:xAxis][:categories] = ["uno" ,"dos" , "tres" , "cuatro"]
     ......

  Overriding entire option:

     @h = LazyHighCharts::HighChart.new('graph') do |f|
       .....
          f.xAxis(:categories => @days.reverse! , :labels=>{:rotation=>-45 , :align => 'right'})
          f.chart({:defaultSeriesType=>"spline" , :renderTo => "myRenderArea" , :inverted => true})
       .....


  Usage in layout:

  <%= javascript_include_tag :high_charts %>

  Usage in view:

    <%= high_chart("my_id", @h) %>
    
  You can pass in additional javascript into to the view with a block, this will be executed before the high chart is called

      <%= high_chart("my_id", @h) do |c| %>
        alert('hello')
      <%end %>
      
  To include javascript function calls or callbacks you can use the js_code method on your string`"function".js_code`:
  
      f.options[:plotOptions] = { 
        :column => { :events => { :click => %|function() { window.location = "http://www.highcharts.com" }|.js_code } }
      }
      

   HighStock Support:

     ##just call HighChart Helper this way:

       <%= high_stock("my_id", @h) %>
