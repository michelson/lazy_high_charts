This gem provides a simple and extremely flexible way to use HighCharts from ruby code.
Tested on Ruby on Rails, Sinatra and Nanoc, but it should work with others too. Highcharts is not free for commercial use, so make sure you have a valid license to use Highcharts.

## Usage:

### Controller code:
```ruby
@chart = LazyHighCharts::HighChart.new('graph') do |f|
  f.title(text: "Population vs GDP For 5 Big Countries [2009]")
  f.xAxis(categories: ["United States", "Japan", "China", "Germany", "France"])
  f.series(name: "GDP in Billions", yAxis: 0, data: [14119, 5068, 4985, 3339, 2656])
  f.series(name: "Population in Millions", yAxis: 1, data: [310, 127, 1340, 81, 65])

  f.yAxis [
    {title: {text: "GDP in Billions", margin: 70} },
    {title: {text: "Population in Millions"}, opposite: true},
  ]

  f.legend(align: 'right', verticalAlign: 'top', y: 75, x: -50, layout: 'vertical')
  f.chart({defaultSeriesType: "column"})
end

@chart_globals = LazyHighCharts::HighChartGlobals.new do |f|
  f.global(useUTC: false)
  f.chart(
    backgroundColor: {
      linearGradient: [0, 0, 500, 500],
      stops: [
        [0, "rgb(255, 255, 255)"],
        [1, "rgb(240, 240, 255)"]
      ]
    },
    borderWidth: 2,
    plotBackgroundColor: "rgba(255, 255, 255, .9)",
    plotShadow: true,
    plotBorderWidth: 1
  )
  f.lang(thousandsSep: ",")
  f.colors(["#90ed7d", "#f7a35c", "#8085e9", "#f15c80", "#e4d354"])
end
```

### View Helpers:
```ruby
<%= high_chart_globals(@chart_globals) %>
<%= high_chart("some_id", @chart) %>
```

`high_chart_globals` is optional. Use it to set the global options of all charts that are currently displayed on the page. More info [here](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts#global).

### No Data

When your series has no data and you want to display a message using Highcharts' noData feature ([Highcarts doc](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/noData)) you have to include the `no-data-to-display.js` file like so:

````
//= require highcharts/highcharts
//= require highcharts/highcharts-more
//= require highcharts/modules/no-data-to-display
````

You can then set the actual message that is displayed like so:

````
    @chart = LazyHighCharts::HighChart.new('graph') do |f|
      f.options[:lang] = { noData: "My beautiful noData message" }
      f.title(text: nil)
      f.series([])
    end
````
